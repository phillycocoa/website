We value the participation of each member of the community and want everyone to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all members are expected to show respect and courtesy to other members and the community at large.

To make clear what is expected, all members, organizers and volunteers associated with the Philly CocoaHeads community are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

## Code of Conduct

The Philly CocoaHeads community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the Philly CocoaHeads community.

These expectations are to be considered during your participation at all group related events and gatherings. It also extends to your behavior in the community at large.

Members violating these rules may be asked to leave the group or disciplined at the sole discretion of the organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly group for all.

## What is Harassment?

Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for the Philly CocoaHeads community.
