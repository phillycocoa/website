title: "Side Project Saturday is at the new Promptworks location"
---


Side Project Saturday is still being sponsored by Promptworks, but the location has moved to 123 S Broad St (the corner of Broad and Sansom), Suite 2400.

Side Project Satruday is an opportunity to work on your iOS/Mac projects in a group setting. It's a great chance to get help 
with your app, share your ideas, and socialize with other developers! Beginners are always welcome!

# New Rules

- Please RSVP by Thursday before the meetup, if at all possible. You can still attend if you don't, but the RSVP list will be provided to building security to facilitate quicker entry.
- Please bring a government-issued ID like a drivers license. Building security will need to see it when you sign-in.
- Please sign-in with security when you arrive before coming up to floor 24.
- WiFi is unchanged.
- Coffee and water are available onsite, but snacks are not for public consumption. Please bring your own snacks, if you wish.
- Bathrooms are available in the office.
- Please only use tables in the common area by the kitchen. Power strips will be provided.

If you have any questions or concerns, please send us an email to leadership@phillycocoa.org. Thanks.
