We decided that we want to work on an AR app, but we still can't figure out what to build. The space is still very new, hardware from Apple doesn't exist yet, and life really got in our way last sprint, so we didn't get much prototype exploration done. This week, we continue our search for an AR app idea, perhaps come up with a germ of an idea by the end, and in the middle, Kotaro expounds on game jams and creative cheats from his own past. It's a diamond in the rough kind of episode, but sometimes that's how it goes when you are trying to start down an unexplored path.

## Topics Discussed:
- Searching for an AR app idea on Twitter
- Types of AR Hardware
- Game Jams & Creative Cheats
- A Prototype Idea for Next Time
- Not a Sponsor: [Happy Scale](https://happyscale.com)
