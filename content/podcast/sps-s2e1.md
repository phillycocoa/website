After a brief retrospective about our last app, Kanji Love, and a shout out to the recently departed [Release Notes](https://releasenotes.tv) podcast, the team starts a discussion about our next project, which looks like it'll be focused on Augmented Reality. First, we ask ourselves, what is the relationship between AR, VR, and the "Metaverse" concept? Then we read the tea leaves of Apple's APIs to make an educated guess about future hardware and types of applications that would be useful to build. Finally, we spend time talking about some specific app ideas and end the episode with some bonus talk about recognizing hand gestures. Next time, we will decide what app we will build for season 2!
