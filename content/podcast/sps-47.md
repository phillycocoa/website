The trio continue to suffer the Beta Blues, but Steve did do his pod homework this round and made a very janky visionOS prototype that lets you apply a pixelation filter to a photo! This leads into some good discussion of photo app features that would be appropriate on visionOS interspersed with some "bad app ideas," a digression about Share Play, and Kotaro & Aaron decide they want to build Cerebro! It's an easy-breezy episode, perfect for these hot summer days.
