On this exciting episode, incremental progress has been made with PickleJarTodo! I know, you're in awe at our productivity. But, the bulk of the episode is a semi-literate discussion about the latest crop of "AI" tools and their potential impact on our discipline of software development. From the current crop of tools like ChatGPT and CoPilot to potential uses in designer/developer collaboration and even full app generation, this discussion is preliminary, but interesting, and we will surely revisit the topic in the future as we gain knowledge and experience in the space.

## Topics Discussed:
- PickleJarTodo Update
    - SwiftLint for TODO warnings
    - Core Data model relationships

- AI and Software Development
    - Azam testing blog post (testing is about confidence)
        - https://azamsharp.com/2023/02/15/testing-is-about-confidence.html
    - Generating code via Figma-like app
    - Apple and AI tools
