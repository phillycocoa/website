The trio continue exploring visionOS despite ongoing beta challenges. Steve updates his experiment with a little more functionality while Kotaro scans a "mutant peach" into a 3D object, and Aaron is stymied in his physics experiments due to inadequate Simulator support. Kotaro provides some insights into what game developers may find familiar and frustrating if they decide to venture into visionOS development before discussing some "hot shader action" coming to SwiftUI in iOS 17. Finally, Bad App Ideas returns, revisiting "Portal Pigeons," and we give a shout-out in our "Not a Sponsor" segment to Happy Scale!
