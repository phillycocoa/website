This week the Trio revisit the topic of "AI" by discussing some of the tools and workflows they have tried out lately. There is some follow-up to last episode's topic of The Composable Architecture, including Steve talking about a side project idea that he may use TCA to implement. Plus, talk of the job market, concurrency in Swift, and Meta Glassholes! It's a long episode, but we think it's pretty interesting. Enjoy!
