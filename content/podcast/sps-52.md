The trio are together once more! This week, Steve and Kotaro discuss Steve's most recent HTTP API Client design, some of which was inspired by Rob Napier's "Generic Swift" talk from several years ago. Then, Steve almost loses his voice trying to poorly explain The Composable Architecture (TCA), but does go into some depth on the pieces and ideas he has applied to real world projects. It's mostly Steve talking this week, but it's pretty interesting stuff. Be sure to check the show notes for links so you can dive deep into these topics yourself!
