The trio have had some initial hands-on time with the visionOS SDK and are ready to dive into a new development adventure. That's right, it's time to pivot! We think visionOS is a rare opportunity that should not be missed by Apple developers. Maybe it's a big nothing burger, maybe it'll be a new App Store gold rush, maybe somewhere in between, but the time to start exploring this new platform is now! In this episode, we talk about what we have already learned from the visionOS SDK before discussing some very rough prototyping ideas we want to use to start exploring this brave new Spatial Computing world.

## Topics Discussed:
- What’s up with PickleJarTodo?
- Pivot to visonOS
    - Physical Dev Kit
    - Apple’s visionOS timeline
    - Knowledge and skills in this space good career wise

    - Scan real paper notes and “fax” them
    - Magnetic Blocks
- For Next Time
    - Pick a prototype that is SMALL
    - Steve: Window app, desaturate photo with basic editor controls
    - Kotaro: Hand gestures 
    - Aaron: Something with 3D models/physics engine
- Final Thoughts
    - Sound will be vital
