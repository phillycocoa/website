Ok, we are really spinning our wheels now getting a new app idea pinned down, but the upshot is there are a lot of interesting subjects touched upon this week, including the "confirmation" of RealityOS, how people occlusion works in ARKit, a tangent about the history of Web API technologies, and much more. Plus, our Not a Sponsor this week could help you keep your food from spoiling!

## Topics Discussed:
- RealityOS is Real!
- How ARKit People Occlusion Works
- What makes a good AR experience, according to Apple
- AR Goggles Pricing and Design
- A Tangent on XML, JSON, gRPC, and Web APIs
- Ray casting and ray tracing
