Twas the pod before WWDC and the trio decided to enjoy themselves with a little speculation about what gifts Apple will bestow on June 5, 2023. Most of the discussion centers on speculation about the "mythical goggles" rumored to be released along with a brief tangent on widgets, some thoughts on whether Apple will even utter the acronym, "AI," during the conference, and we end with a nerdy grab bag wishlist of features we hope to see added to Apple's platforms this year. Don't miss the Not a Sponsor segment this week as Steve demonstrates that the Clip Dish devs' prompt engineering is second to none!
