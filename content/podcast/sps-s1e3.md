Sprint 2 is done and we have data! In this episode, we check-in on our goals for the sprint and discuss what got done, what didn't, and some interesting issues that came up along the way. Now that we have Kanji data in the Core Data database, we can shift focus to building the UI for the app and notifications for next time. 

## Follow-up from last sprint: 
 - Wireframes and prototype UI
 - Kanji database parsed into JSON
 - Core Data stack setup
 - Everyone get the app built and run on their watches
 - Look into how notifications might work
 - Get a podcast website setup

### Steve
- Got podcast website done
- No notifications

### Aaron
- Got subset of data parsed into Core Data (3,000 kanji!)

### Kotaro
- Started skeleton layout of all views
- Hasn't hooked up UI to Core Data, yet.

## Topics Discussed:
- Hugo as an option for building your podcast or app website
- PRs for collaboration on GitHub
- Analysis Paralysis and comic book artists
- Core Data array magic with the transformable attribute
- UI mechanics
- What are the stats we are saving?
- Extensions on CoreData models (like Kotaro's Fav10)

## Next Time:
- Working prototype swipe UI and save user stats (Kotaro)
- Working notifications (Steve)
- Public interface to the Kanji database (Aaron)
