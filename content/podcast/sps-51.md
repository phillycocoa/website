Kotaro hosts solo one more time this week to briefly talk about "secret sauces." No, not the kind you use on nuggets! It's that ineffable quality of an app that makes you love it vs those annoying anti-patterns often prevalent in apps created just to catch the wave of a hype cycle. Kotaro wants to make apps he loves and that you might love, too! This is a short, but practical and personal essay celebrating some apps that found their "secret sauce."

## Topics Discussed:
- Introductions
    - iOS 17 is out
    - Xcode 15 is out!
    - To continue work on visionOS keep Xcode 15 Beta 8 around.
    - New iPhones out. Dynamic Island is available across the board.
- What is the secret sauce in an app that makes you love it?
    - Hype cycle
	- Generative AI
	- AR/VR
	- Crypto
	- How can I make a cool app with these? Lots of bad ideas
    - Personal favorites:
        - Modo
        - SoundStudio
        - Sketch
        - Procreate (also Procreate Pocket)
- One More Thing: GetClipDish.com
