The trio has returned from their holiday break to talk about 2024 developer resolutions! Aaron wants to build an "AI" model and interact with hardware. Steve is looking at backend stuff for a change of pace. Kotaro is talking himself into building a visionOS game. There is also some good discussion of some "AI" application ideas and tools we've been using. With the Vision Pro on the immediate horizon, we also discuss how much we should invest in the platform if we aren't buying one of the launch devices. It's a nice easy introduction to 2024 with lots more to come. Here's to a new year in our developer journeys! Now, let's get to work!
