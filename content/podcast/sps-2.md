Our first sprint encountered some hiccups and we are off to a slow start, but progress has been made!  This week, we have some follow-up about changes to our initial App Store Connect environment, describe how we setup the podcast, and spend the majority of the meeting talking about data sources, structures, and UI. 

Topics include:

- Switching to an App Store Connect Team account for development

- Podcast infrastructure setup with Anchor.fm and Podcast Connect

- Exploring Kanji databases using Python in Google Collab

- What data do we really *need* for a "card" in the app?

- What kind of stats do we need to track and where do we store this data?

- What are the primary user interface interactions?


Goals for next time: 

- Wireframes and prototype UI

- Kanji database parsed into JSON

- Core Data stack setup

- Everyone get the app built and run on their watches

- Look into how notifications might work

- Get a podcast website setup
