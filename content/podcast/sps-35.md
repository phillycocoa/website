Steve's voice is back...like 95%! Tune in this week for an update about PickleJarTodo where, as usual, we quickly go off the rails into a classic Kotaro rant about JIRA! We also have some discussion about the perennial SwiftUI issue, integrating Core Data. Plus, some pros and cons we have found trying to use GitHub Projects and we end by setting some semi-realistic goals for next time!

## Topics Discussed:
- PickleJarTodo Update
    - Side Projects Can Help Day Job Projects
    - GitHub Projects Tickets
        - Kotaro Rants About JIRA Slowness. ðŸ¤£
        - GitHub Projects Discussion
    - Core Data is Our Nemesis
    - Core Data design patterns in SwiftUI
- Next:
    - Kotaro: Wire up UI components
    - Steve: Core Data Model layer CRUD
    - Aaron: Layout review sections/settings
