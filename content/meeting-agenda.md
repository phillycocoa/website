# June Meeting Agenda

The next [Philly CocoaHeads][PC] meeting will be virtual on **Thursday, June 11th**. Join us online for a virtual social hour (bring your own pizza). We're resuming monthly meetings virtually for the time being in a more casual format, akin to the social hour that kicks off our in-person meetings.

We'll be meeting via Zoom (link will be on Meetup after you RSVP). Please RSVP via Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/>.

Bring some questions if you need some office-hours, or just come and hang as we talk about the latest rumors leading up to WWDC next month.
