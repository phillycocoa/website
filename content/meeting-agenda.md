# August Meeting Agenda

The next [Philly CocoaHeads][PC] meeting will be virtual on **Thursday, August 13th**. Join us online for a virtual social hour (bring your own pizza). We're resuming monthly meetings virtually for the time being in a more casual format, akin to the social hour that kicks off our in-person meetings. 

[PC]:http://phillycocoa.org

We'll be meeting via Zoom (link will be on Meetup after you RSVP). Please RSVP via Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/>.
