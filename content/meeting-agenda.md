## Before the Meeting
We meet out of <a href="https://www.indyhall.org">Indy Hall</a>, a co-working community in Old City. They've extended a discount to our group to come in early and work out of Indy Hall for the day. When you get there, mention CocoaHeads and you'll receive $10 off the normal drop-in rate (you'll get in for $20). Many CocoaHeads members are also Indy Hall members, so you'll see some of us around. Avoid the rush hour commute and join us!

## Social Hour
When the doors open we kick off the meeting with our social hour. Don't skip out on this - it's the perfect time to say hi to new members, hack on a side project, and pick each others' brains about problems you're running into. Bring your laptop and take advantage of our helpful community to push through that problem you just can't quite seem to Stack Overflow your way out of. The outside doors are locked by 7:00PM, so come join us for the Social Hour before the Main Meeting begins.

## Presentations
### When a Simple Algorithm will Do: Joe Cieplinski
Sometimes when building apps, we come across a simple problem and try to attack it with a very complex solution. We may, for example, envision training a complex neural network to track a customer’s behavior, when all we need is to collect some data and feed it a simple, good old-fashioned algorithm.

In designing custom notifications last summer for RECaf, I ran into this exact situation. My ultimate solution, while not anything particularly fancy, is remarkably effective at solving a common problem many apps face: How do you create useful — not annoying — reminders?

In this talk, we’ll walk through how RECaf analyzes your logging behavior and custom tailors local notifications to remind you to log your caffeine. I’ll discuss the design of RECaf’s notification generator and show how it works in code.

With some thoughtfulness in the design process, our apps can be more intelligent without having to become PhDs in Machine Learning.
