<p>Our main meeting is held once a month, usually on the second Thursday of the month. The meeting starts at 6:30pm with a hour of social pizza time and help time. Later we do formal group introductions and presentations. These presentations can be anywhere from 10-15m to more formalized talks (30m each). The meeting ends around 9:00pm. Some people usually followup the meeting at a local bar for a drink. All are welcome to join us.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or would like to present at the meeting, please get in touch with Mike Zornek, <a href="mailto:zorn@phillycocoa.org">zorn@phillycocoa.org</a>.</p>
